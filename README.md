# Wireless SCC Hardware

The hardware for the SCCs is designed in **Ki-CAD**. This particular folder contains design for the *actuation node* which are deployed in SCCs. 

Actuation nodes control lights, fans and ACs. They are designed in such a way that they can be directly mounted on an 8-channel relay board in order to reduce footprint of the hardware. At max the node can connect to 12 appliances. 

The folder are explained as follows: 

1. *footprints* : Contains footprints for all the necessary components.
2. *libraries* : Contains libraries required for the project. The folder also contains some custom made libraries. Pls, see this tutorial on how to [make and add custom component in Ki-CAD](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=add+custom+components+in+kicad&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#kpvalbx=1).

Other files contain schematic and pcb file of the hardware.
